what is AWS?
- AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud platform that provides on-demand computing, storage, networking, databases, AI/ML, security, and more. 
- Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers, businesses use AWS to scale and manage resources efficiently.

AWS offers a vast range of services for various use cases! 
While this project doesn’t require me to be familiar with all of them, the following are a few key services that helped me understand the types of solutions AWS provides 
and how they are billed.

1. AWS CodePipeline 
2. Elastic Load Balancing
3. RDS
4. Route 53
5. S3


1. AWS CodePipeline Explained Simply

Imagine you’re baking a cake. You have a step-by-step process:
	1.	Gather ingredients
	2.	Mix the batter
	3.	Bake in the oven
	4.	Decorate

Now, think of CodePipeline as your automated kitchen assistant that follows this process every single time you bake a cake. 
Instead of doing each step manually, CodePipeline ensures everything happens in the correct order without you having to watch over it.
